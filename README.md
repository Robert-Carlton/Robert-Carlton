# AI, Machine Learning & Analytics | Marketing | Communications 

I'm a professional with 25+ years of experience in **Marketing** and **Communications**,  focused on harnessing the power of **AI** and **Analytics** to drive business insights and solutions. I thrive on creating data-driven strategies that bridge the gap between marketing and technology.

## üöÄ Projects
- Customer churn prediction focused on approaches to handling missing data and a comparison of differing data imputation techniques and their impact on prediction outcomes. [Paper here](https://github.com/Robert-Carlton/Telco-Churn-Reduction)
- Drive-through simiulation focused on simple strategies for reducing drive-through tailback onto public roadways. [Paper here](https://github.com/RobertCProjects/Drive-through-Simulation-Study/blob/main/DriveThroughSimulation.pdf)
- Stock price prediction modeling using ensemble models and technical, fundamental and social data. [Poster here](https://github.com/Robert-Carlton/Stock-Price-Prediction/blob/main/team128poster.pdf)
- Natural language processing focused on signals extraction from unstructured textual data leveraging large language models, prompt engineering and classification. [Paper here](https://github.com/Robert-Carlton/Signals-Extraction)
