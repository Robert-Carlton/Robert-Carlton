# AI, Machine Learning & Analytics | Marketing | Communications 

I'm a professional with 25+ years of experience in **Marketing** and **Communications**,  focused on harnessing the power of **AI** and **Analytics** to drive business insights and solutions. I thrive on creating data-driven strategies that bridge the gap between marketing and technology. 

My AI / analytics experience reflects both the theoretical and applied aspects of analytics and AI. Notable work includes developing a churn model evaluating data imputation techniques, stock price prediction using ensemble methods, and signals extraction (NLP) from unstructured text leveraging LLMs, generative AI, prompt engineering and classification. Additionally, I have designed queuing simulations integrating image recognition and tracking with machine learning frameworks.

## 🚀 Projects
- Customer churn prediction focused on approaches to handling missing data and a comparison of differing data imputation techniques and their impact on prediction outcomes. [Paper here](https://github.com/Robert-Carlton/Telco-Churn-Reduction/blob/main/README.md)
- Drive-through simulation focused on simple strategies for reducing drive-through tailback onto public roadways. [Paper here](https://github.com/Robert-Carlton/Drive-through-Simulation-Study/blob/main/README.md)
- Stock price prediction modeling using ensemble models and technical, fundamental and social data. [Poster here](https://github.com/Robert-Carlton/Stock-Price-Prediction/blob/main/README.md)
- Natural language processing focused on signals extraction from unstructured textual data leveraging large language models, prompt engineering and classification. [Paper here](https://github.com/Robert-Carlton/Signals-Extraction/blob/main/README.md)
